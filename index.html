  <p>Oficially "Tulancingo de Bravo" Second largest city of the state of Hidalgo. The name derives from the Nahuatl words “tule” and “tzintle” which mean “in or behind the reeds.”</p>
  <p><h2>Brief History</h2> A city was founded in 645 BCE by the Toltecs with the name Tolancingo as part of the empire centered in Tula. During the Spanish invasion and due to the warm climate and fertile soil the land attracted a lot of spanish settlers, especially older ones. In time, the area became known as the “Retiring place of Old Conquistadors.” During the Mexican fight for independence Tulancingo was occupied by Nicolas Bravo and Guadalupe Victoria; Bravo remained here for a time, founding a newspaper called El Mosquito de Tulancingo and constructing a gunpowder factory. This would lead to “de Bravo” being added as an appendage to the city's name in 1858.</p>
